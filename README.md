## Towards driving Quantum Systems in cryogenic environments with the Near-Field of Modulated Electron Beams

Coherent electromagnetic control of quantum systems is usually done by electromagnetic radiation - which does not
permit addressing single site-selected quantum systems, especially in the microwave range. In our proof of concept
experiment we want to couple for the first time the non-radiative electromagnetic near-field of a spatially modulated
electron beam to a quantum system in a coherent way as has been proposed lately. As the quantum system we use the
unpaired electron spins of a free radical organic sample (Koelsch radical, BDPA) that is excited via the near-field
of the aloof electron beam. The readout of the spin excitation resembles a classic continuous wave electron spin
resonance experiment and is done inductively via a microcoil using a lock-in amplifier.

The long term perspective of this experiment is the ability to coherently drive and investigate quantum systems in a
spatial volume way below the diffraction limit of traditional electromagnetic wave based excitation schemes. The
spatially confined excitation using an electron beam could also be realized within an electron microscope. Within
the last year we have been able to improve the setup, couple the electron beam to the microcoil and reduce noise
sources as well as started preparations to cool down the microcoil setup to cryogenic temperatures for enhanced signal
to noise ratio.
