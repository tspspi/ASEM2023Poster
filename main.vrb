  \begin{block}{\large Abstract}
    Coherent electromagnetic control of quantum systems is usually done by
    electromagnetic radiation - which does not permit addressing single site-selected
    quantum systems, especially in the microwave range. In our proof of concept
    experiment we want to couple for the first time the non-radiative electromagnetic
    near-field of a spatially modulated electron beam to a quantum system in
    a coherent way as has been proposed lately.  As the quantum system we
    use the unpaired electron spins of a free radical organic sample (Koelsch radical
    \- $\alpha,\gamma$-Bisdiphenylene-$\beta$-phenylallyl) that is excited via the
    near-field of the aloof electron beam. The readout of the spin excitation
    resembles a classic continuous wave electron spin resonance experiment and is
    done inductively via a microcoil using a lock-in amplifier.

    The long term perspective of this experiment is the ability to coherently drive
    and investigate quantum systems in a spatial volume way below the diffraction
    limit of traditional electromagnetic wave based excitation schemes. The spatially
    confined excitation using an electron beam could also be realized within
    an electron microscope. Within the last year we have been able to improve
    the setup, couple the electron beam to the microcoil and reduce noise sources
    as well as started preparations to cool down the microcoil setup to cryogenic
    temperatures for enhanced signal to noise ratio.

        The experiment resembles an electron spin resonance experiment. In contrast to
        classic electron spin resonance setups where systems are excited using microwaves
        we use the \textit{non-radiative electromagnetic near-field} of an electron beam.

      \begin{block}{\large Temperature dependence}
        We want to move to a cryogenic environment. This is done due to the small signal generated by the modulated electron beam.
        The thermal population of spin states is heavily temperature dependent:

        $$\frac{n_2}{n_1} = e^{-\frac{\Delta E}{k_B T}} = \left(e^{- \frac{\Delta E}{k_B}}\right)^\frac{1}{T}$$

              \item Moving to $77K$ (liquid nitrogen): \\ expect $8.9nV$ signal \\ expected gain $\approx 4$, SNR gain $\approx 7.7$ \\ simple to realize, our choice
              \item Moving to $4K$ (liquid helium): \\ expect $1.7\mu V$ signal \\ expected gain $\approx 764$, SNR gain $\approx 650$ \\ challenging to realize
              \item Averaging increases the SNR by $\sqrt{N}$ for N iterations. Doubling SNR of the system decreases the number of required averages by a factor of four. A gain of 4 decreases measurement time by a factor of 16,
              a gain of 650 would decrease measurement time by about half a million

      \begin{block}{\large First tests on test setup}
        We did some initial tests on our setup by simply cooling a PCB containing our
        BDPA sample in a liquid nitrogen bath. The sample then was excited using microwaves
        coupled in via a directional coupler as in a traditional setup. We saw the
        expected increase in signal amplitude as well as a shift of our impedance match
        that we have to compensate for.
